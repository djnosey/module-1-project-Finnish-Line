        <h3 class="question">How to say please in Finnsh?</h3>
        <p class="answer">The Finnish Language has no word for "please". 
            “Please” is often incorrectly translated for tourists as “ole hyvä” 
            – however, this is more of an equivalent of “there you go” or “de nada”. 
            In case you still want to be polite and ask someone to pass the vodka, 
            please, you can use the word for “thank you” instead – kiitos.</p>
