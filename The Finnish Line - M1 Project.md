You can make a free text search, choose some of our pre determined categories including; winter, children, design or nightlife. **The Finnish Line** has been developed as a front-end project for Ironhack's web development course. written in vanilla javascript it utilises MyHelsinkiOpenAPI to fetch the events and auroraslive.io to give you your chances of seeing the northern lights.
